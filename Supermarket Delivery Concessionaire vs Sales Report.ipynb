    "## 1.0 Introduction\n",
    "This case study focuses on a Distributor of consumer products supplying items to supermarkets across the Philippines. The distributor operates through a Delivery Concessionaire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 🛒 Concessionaire Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributor Role: Provides products to supermarkets nationwide.\n",
    "- Concessionaire Role: Ensures delivery, display, and monitoring of items in each store.\n",
    "- Supermarket Payment: The supermarket pays only for items sold to customers, not for the delivered stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Because payment is tied to sales, the distributor and concessionaire must closely monitor:\n",
    "- Inventory Levels: Track how much stock is delivered vs. how much remains unsold.\n",
    "- Sales Data: Ensure timely reporting of quantities sold per store.\n",
    "- Replenishment Needs: Decide if stores require additional deliveries or if existing stock is sufficient.\n",
    "- Pricing Accuracy: Confirm that SRPs (Suggested Retail Prices) are correctly applied at checkout.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsold Inventory: Why are items not selling? (pricing, demand, display issues, competition).\n",
    "- Stock Visibility: Nationwide operations make it difficult to track inventory in real time.\n",
    "- Cash Flow Risks: Since supermarkets only pay for sold items, distributors carry the risk of unsold stock.\n",
    "- Operational Efficiency: Coordinating deliveries, monitoring sales, and adjusting replenishment across multiple stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Case Study Focus\n",
    "This case study will analyze how the concessionaire model impacts:\n",
    "- Distributor-supermarket relationships.\n",
    "- Inventory management and sales monitoring.\n",
    "- Profitability and risk management.\n",
    "- Strategies for improving visibility and ensuring correct SRPs nationwide.\n",
